            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science student who enjoys building creative applications that are both useful and impactful. At the CBU AI & Machine Learning Lab, I've worked on projects that connect data, automation, and real-world problems for partners like the Department of Defense. This has given me the chance to dive into Salesforce, Data Cloud, and Apex while learning how to turn ideas into working solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
                Outside of work, I like exploring different ways to create with technology. I've built platformer games in Unity, experimented with web and app development, and customized my own development setups across Linux, macOS, and Windows. These projects let me mix personal problem-solving with creativity, and I enjoy figuring things out one step at a time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Whether it's coding, designing, or experimenting with new tools, I'm motivated by curiosity and the process of making something better than it was before.

                <p class="project-subtitle">Developed while working @ CAiMLL (CBU AI and Machine Learning Lab)</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Version 1 (Salesforce-Native):</strong> Architected and developed an end-to-end Salesforce matching engine using Apex to recommend related objects via vector cosine similarity through Data Cloud's SQL Connect API namespace.</li>
                    <li>Designed and implemented a smart caching system with batch processing and queueable architecture to persist recommendations in-org, reducing recommendation latency by 90%—from 45-60 seconds to ~3 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Built a dynamic recommendation controller supporting bidirectional matching across multiple object types, with configurable processing flows and automated retry logic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Version 2 (GCP Integration):</strong> Collaborated with a small team to migrate the matching engine to Google Cloud Platform, owning the Salesforce-to-GCP data integration pipeline.</li>
                    <li>Developed Python scripts to extract Salesforce data via the Salesforce API, transform it into vector embeddings, and load it into PostgreSQL, establishing a robust ETL pipeline for recommendation generation.</li>
                    <li>Built bidirectional sync tools to import GCP-generated recommendations back into Salesforce, mapping complex metadata including LLM token usage, similarity scores, and recommendation reports.</li>
                    <li>Automated the data integration workflow to eliminate manual intervention, currently in production with plans for full automation.</li>
                    <li>Both versions are deployed to production, actively used by leadership to accelerate data-driven decision-making and collaboration across research teams.</li>
